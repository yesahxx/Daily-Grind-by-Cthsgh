      <h4>Location: 185025 Coffee St, Latte City, Matcha<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)</h4>
      
      Atmosphere<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)<br>
      
      Coffee Haven offers a cozy, relaxed environment that‚Äôs perfect for both casual meetings and solo visits.<br>
       The d√©cor is modern with warm, earthy tones, making it a great place to unwind.<br>
       There‚Äôs plenty of seating, including plush armchairs and some high-top tables for a more social vibe.<br>
       The background music is chill but not overpowering, adding to the ambiance without distracting from conversations.<br>
       It can get a little crowded during peak hours, but the vibe remains welcoming.<br>
      <br>
      Customer Service<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)<br>
      
      The staff is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable about their menu.<br>
       I asked for a recommendation, and they were more than happy to suggest a few drinks based on my preferences.<br>
       The baristas are quick to prepare drinks and are always willing to chat if you're a regular.<br>
       Overall, they create a warm and welcoming environment.<br>
      <br>
      Menu<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)<br>
      
      Coffee Haven has a solid selection of drinks, including various espresso-based options, cold brews, and seasonal specialties.<br>
       They also offer pastries and a few savory snacks like sandwiches and salads. I tried the signature caramel latte,<br>
       and it was smooth with just the right balance of sweetness and coffee flavor. The pastries, especially the blueberry muffins,were fresh and delicious.<br>
        The only downside is that their menu is slightly more limited compared to other local coffee shops, but what they do, they do well.<br>
      <br>
      Quality of Coffee<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)<br>
      
      This is where Coffee Haven really shines. The coffee is brewed to perfection, with rich flavors and a smooth finish.<br>
       They use high-quality beans and it‚Äôs clear they take their coffee seriously. Whether you‚Äôre into strong espressos or creamy lattes,<br>
       their beverages are consistently top-notch. The cold brew is another standout‚Äîrich, smooth, and not overly bitter.<br>
      <br>
      Pricing<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5)<br>
      
      Prices are a little on the higher end, but it's expected for the quality of coffee and the experience.<br>
       A regular latte is around $5, which is typical for a specialty coffee shop. However, <br>
      some people may find it a bit much for a daily routine, especially if you're a regular consumer of coffee.<br>
      <br>
      Wi-Fi and Power Outlets<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5)<br>
      
      While there is Wi-Fi available, it‚Äôs not the fastest connection. For people looking to do a bit of work or study,<br>
       it‚Äôs decent but not the best for long hours of heavy internet use. There are power outlets scattered around the caf√©,<br>
       but they are not as plentiful as other coffee shops, so if you need one, it‚Äôs worth arriving early.<br>
      <br>
      Overall Experience<br>
      Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)<br>
      
      Coffee Haven is a great choice for anyone who loves a good cup of coffee in a relaxed setting. The quality of coffee is exceptional,<br>
       and the friendly service makes it a pleasant place to spend time. While the prices and limited menu might not appeal to everyone,<br>
       it‚Äôs a perfect spot for coffee lovers who appreciate a high-quality brew.</p>
